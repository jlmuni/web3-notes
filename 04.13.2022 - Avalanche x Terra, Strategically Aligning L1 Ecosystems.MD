#### Why diversify the reserve?
* **_Do_**: understand this by speaking the language of nations
  * Terra’s original use case was mostly stable use cases on the Terra blockchain
    * For LUNA users, UST is perfectly stable
  * ...but UST’s potential is to be the ‘decentralized money across all blockchains’, not just Terra
  > ‘Crypto deserves a sovereign money that benefits all ecosystems and is credibly backed by some of the leading assets in the industry’
    * It made sense to diversify assets
    * BTC: neutrality
      * This reduces economic risk of UST; and increases confidence in UST amongst various blockchains, as it’s backed by an ecosystem-neutral asset
  	*	Avalanche: we have ‘big plans’ on how to grow UST adoption here, and as UST grows, helps align incentives with AVAX ecosystem
      * This will also reduce AVAX supply as UST grows
*	**_Emin_**: stablecoins currently carry risk (namely, centralized)
  * We need a decentralized stablecoin that can’t be usurped by any power

#### How’d this start?
* AVAX ecosystem teams consistent feedback: 
  * AVAX-backed stablecoin, or at least a ‘more credibly neutral’ backing

#### Ecosystems collaborate
  * **_Do_**: AVAX projects seems to be ‘raising each other up’—strong community with common set of goals—rather than cutting each other down competitively

#### Do’s Avalanche thesis
* In every bull market, we’re reminded of block gentrification, and in every bear market, we forget it exists
  * If blockchains are cities, the only ways to scale are:
    * moving to satellite cities
    * building more buildings
  * Any sufficiently credible distributed system has finite block space
    * You can scale like Hong Kong...
    * or scale horizontally
* Cosmos uses SDK and IBC ([Inter Blockchain Communication](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/ibc/overview.html))
* Avalanche:
  * End-state model is creating Subnets for various use cases, then scale horizontally
    * DeFi Kingdoms coming to Avalanche is a great PoC for this 
    * watch DFK’s performance over next few months
* Avalanche’s scaling and onboarding vision is compelling, Do wanted a seat at the table as a leading decentralized money

#### How does AVAX work as reserve?
* Mechanism: works as a virtual AMM with stiff pricing
  * At any given time, users who want UST from Avalanche c-chain can trade $1 of AVAX for $1 of UST
    * ([c-chain](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4058262-what-is-the-contract-chain-c-chain))
  * As more UST is created, this virtual AMM contains more AVAX
  * Redeeming UST gets $0.99 AVAX
    * asymmetry: reserves only to be used when stablecoin is contracting
      * this ensures the reserve isn’t used as a vanilla AMM (running arb trades), but is used to only create / redeem stablecoins
* What does it do?
  * This makes a native create-redeem mechanism on Avalanche chain
    * no bridges, cross chain reserve operations needed
  * If UST adoption on Avalanche grows, this increases AVAX in reserve pool
    * aligns incentives of the stablecoin with the host ecosystem
* **_Emin_**: allows for UST use in DeFi
* **_Do_**: language of nations
  * Think of blockchains / projects as nations
  * Terra’s greatest export is UST (decentralized money)
  * This provides a better alignment of incentives as ‘nations’ engage in trade

#### Stablecoin
* For AMMs, need to think about the strength of the economy that backs the stablecoin, not simply the mechanism
* Ex.: the Fed has a significantly smaller reserve vs. EM CBs
* The bigger win: if UST grows faster in the Avalanche ecosystem (than it would without Avalanche)

#### Avalanche positioning -> UST growth
* Avalanche projects using UST will be covered in the grants program at Terraform Capital
  * This will help in bootstrapping costs, audits, 
  * Initial setup costs coverage allows for a more community-based project, rather than focus on raising money
* Suite of apps TFL helped create
* Simplifying Anchor UI

#### Subnets
> ‘It becomes really easy to bootstrap your own block space that other people won’t be using’
* Games (many users) need independent, dedicated block space—quality of service must be independent of other games
* Avalanche: extremely performant, bandwidth to oneself, then can customize how execution, consensus works without subscribing to a monolithic tech stack
* **_Emin_**: Avalanche creation resulted from a breakthrough in consensus protocol
  * Ava has the worlds ‘fastest consensus protocol that is also the most decentralized’
    * millions of validators playing a part in every decision
  * Subnets allow horizontal scaling
  * Weaknesses of competitors: fully centralized, no means of fraud detection, not scalable due to hardware sharing / bottlenecks

#### Gaming Subnets
* Terra is ‘very attractive’ for transacting with gaming economies
  * Supporting multiple types of stablecoins
  * Quality on- and off-ramps; intended set of SDKs and APIs
  * Solves:
    * launching rails on ‘a global, distributed audience’
    * traditional rails charge high fees (apple’s OS pay)

#### Notable projects
* A large, existing web2 metaverse platform moving to web3
  * import NFTs, becomes 3D avatar, interacts with others in a 3D space
* DeFi apps
  * Prism protocol: take yield-bearing assets, refracts to one token that gives physical delivery of the yield (monthly, etc.), and another that tracks price of principal
    * allows for directional bets on yield
    * ex.: mint yToken and pToken, sell pToken, buy more yTokens (leveraged access to yield)

#### Future AVAX purchases
* [Bitcoin Reserve Pool](https://agora.terra.money/t/bitcoin-reserve-pool/5259)
* AVAX purchases into liquidity pools: even if not the full reserve mechanism, ppl would have deep liquidity for Terra stablecoins on Avalanche

#### Q&A Session
* Local currencies on subnets?
> **_Emin_**: ‘Absolutely essential that any new financial rail…be not monolothic’
> This can’t be to merely enrich the token on which it’s built; ‘but to create a platform for others to create digital assets’
> ‘Give everyone the ability to create their own digital assets with their own behaviors’
  * Lots of regulatory uncertainty, tho…
* Why Avalanche over other L1s?
* > **_Do_**: ‘deep believer in Avalanche’s ability to scale’
  * one of the most vibrant, fastest growing web3 ecosystems
  * Subnets provide an opportunity to service higher-load apps, by not sharing block space with other apps
* UST as gas token in Subnets, or VM for LUNA?
  * Emin: 
  * [Spaces VM](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/platform/subnets/spaces/)
  * [WAGMI VM](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/platform/subnets/wagmi/)
  * People want to use their own token as gas, and this is supported ([see](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/platform/subnets/create-a-virtual-machine-vm))
