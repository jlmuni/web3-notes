UST: 
* different than Maker. 
* Algorithmic stablecoin 
* Mechanism: mint UST by burning LUNA, vice versa. 
* LUNA: staking token and share token. Secures technical consensus risk + economic risk. 
  * LUNA captures value from use of its main stablecoin. 
  * Vertically integrated, captures value from its main application.
* Protocol native: minted and burned at protocol-level. 

Market growth: 
* Demand for UST->UST trades above the USD, incentive to mint UST, capture arb. 
* Yield: comes from network fees, not inflation-based. (cf.: Remi's tweet below)

Strengths vs. weaknesses (Jordi): 
* You donâ€™t see a problem until there is one. 
* There will â€˜be a straw that breaks the camelâ€™s back at some point.â€™ 
* Retail + whales -> if thereâ€™s a rush for the exit, large sophisticated players can beat the exit.
* (Jose): Titan, others (like Empty Set Dollar)â€¦arenâ€™t comparable due to the magnitude of Terra's success. 

Supply: LUNA doesnâ€™t have a fixed supply. LUNA inflates from UST weakness.

Joseâ€”why bullish?:
* â€™stablecoins are cryptoâ€™s killer appâ€¦
* the endgame is decentralized stablecoins.â€™ 
* UST is the largest decentralized stablecoin, and growing. 

Jordiâ€”why bearish?
* â€˜I am in Anchorâ€¦â€™
* Huge amount of assumptions between here and the endgame (decentralized stablecoin)
  * overcollaterlized is capital-inefficient
  * â€¦but: weâ€™re many steps removed from here to execution
  * will this peg hold thru volatility? (reduction in demand, or bear market)
  * even if it doesnâ€™t depeg, competition from other L1s adding stablecoins threatens Terra / UST

Algo stables: utility and demand issue, not simply a mechanism / design problem. 
* Money is for: spending + deferred spending (investment)
* Compelling primitives / protocols
  * Spending case: Alice [aice.co][https://www.alice.co], [@alice_finance](https://twitter.com/alice_finance)
  * Algo stables not inherently unstable; but focused on ponzi-demand incentives, and no real demand sustains the token

Jordi
* Whatâ€™s on Terra?: 
* Chai: payment system, limited success. 
* 	Mirror: synthetics competitor on-chain for world-wide accessibility. Reality: regulatory- + stability-side, assets arenâ€™t stable
> The killer app: Anchor, a savings bank. 
  >1. Simple enough
  >2. 	Desirable enough
  >3. 	Created a surge in UST. 

Issues:
  * civil resistance is hard to solve. 
  * â€¦but this attracts [Degenbox](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/abracadabra-money-the-degenbox-guide-37d54fc4c4da) (wrapping MIM with UST for yield) types, not as much real ppl
  * What if it depegs?
    * 	much stronger than priors, not sure it depegs
  * risks:
    * market goes down, LUNA goes down, investors lose trust in UST (collateralization goes down, bank rush)
    * yield: if 20% -> 10%, less demand for UST, mint more LUNA, begins the death spiral
    * thereâ€™s a multiplier effect on LUNAâ€™s market cap in burning UST

Jose
* Question is: at what point is yield not worth the risk?
* Joseâ€™s take: sub-10% (still thinks Anchor will dominate into the future)
* Similar to Paypalâ€™s early spend [see Founders At Work by Livingston](http://www.foundersatwork.com)
* Disagrees with Terra not attracting users. Anchorâ€™s grown UST supply to $16B
* â€˜Do [Kwon] can fund this yield reserve for quite a long timeâ€™
* â€˜Most no brainer marketing spend everâ€™
* Anchor rate is liability for the platform. Simulations: given current borrowing activity, how much yield can payout?: 
  * if LFG stops topping up, still see 7-12%*
* Demand: itâ€™s the best place to borrow most PoS, L1 assets. 
* Model: you give up PoS staking yield, and get Anchor incentives + ability to borrow cheaply

LFG: buying BTC
* not proof of Terra ecosystem not working. They're simply making it better
* Jordi: universally agreed with this, even from the bears
* Is Terraâ€™s foreign asset reserves different than a bank?
* Jose: itâ€™s an unsolved problem, bringing BTC to Terra in the most trustless way
* Now, BTC is custodied by the LFG foundation (not ideal)
* but this doesnâ€™t make it a bank. Holding assets doesnâ€™t make it a bank.
* Not an admission of flaw; itâ€™s a growth / evolution in the model
  * cf.: ETH -> ETH2.0

Probability of depeg - risk:
* 2 risks: 
  * Reduction in UST demand, and 
  * Comps from other L1s

Death spiral risk:
* Dai nearly blew up. These all have risks (smart contract bugs, death spirals)
* Decentralized stables have other risk: govâ€™t censorship
* Dai prioritizes safety over growth; UST, growth over downside risk
* Dai:
  * leverage grows DAI, not demand for DAI
  * maker competes with other lending platforms for this
* UST can grow much quicker, but tail risk with reflexivity death spiral
* LUNA bear market / crash: 
  * LUNA mints upon UST redemptions
  * UST demand contraction, LUNA goes down
* LUNAâ€™s backed by 3 things:
  * non-speculative demand
  * LUNA itself
  * absorbs shifts in demand for UST
  * BTC reserve
  * escape hatch, breaks reflexivity spiral
  * instead of minting LUNA, holders can redeem UST for BTC
* Is $3B enough?
  * no one knows
  * canâ€™t model
  * psychological impact â€˜will be hugeâ€™
  * effects
  * network, lending liquidity
  * LUNA can grow reserves thru seigniorage and on the 2ndary market

Algo stables: howâ€™s this sustained in the bad times?
* May 2021: averse market conditions, LUNA dropped from $20->3
  * changed params for minting / liquidity
  * UST was much smaller when this happenedâ€¦
  * promising: while LUNA dropped, you saw deposits on Anchor increase (flee to UST-safety from LUNA: this is good! but Jordi sees this only reflecting the communityâ€™s beliefs)
